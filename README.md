# **Brain Tumor Classification**

---

In this project, Support Vector Machines (SVM) are used to train a model to classify if an image contains a a brain tumot or not. The feature representation method Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Histogram are used as the feature representation. 

## libraries we need for this project

---




 

*   **os**: just for file and directory operations.
*   **cv2**: provides a wide range of functions and algorithms for image and video processing: feature extraction, object detection, and more.
*  **Numpy**: for data analysis, and machine learning applications. 
*   **Pyplot**: to generate line plots, bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and more
*   **SVC**: provides functions for training and predicting with SVM-based classifiers
*   **train_test_split**: used for splitting a dataset into training and testing subsets
* **accuracy_score**: calculates the accuracy of classification models by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels
* **confusin_matrix**: generates a confusion matrix, which is a table that presents the performance of a classification model by visualizing the predicted and true labels for each class.

* **matplotlib**: rovides a high-level interface for creating and customizing plots and visualizations. 
* **hog**: for object detection and recognition. It captures shape and texture information by analyzing local gradients in an image.
* **seaborn**:  for data analysis and presentation.
* **pandas**: DataFrame object, which is a two-dimensional table-like data structure. It allows you to load, manipulate, and analyze structured data, such as CSV files,  It allows you to load data from external sources, perform data transformations, and save the results back to different file formats.
